#### Queues, Tries, and Zip ####
-   The ADT for a WorkList explicitly forbids access to the middle elements.  However, the FixedSizeFIFOWorkList has a peek(i) method
    which allows you to do exactly that.  Why is this an acceptable addition to the WorkList ADT in this particular case but not in general?<pre>

-   One of the applications of Tries is in solving Word Searches.  A "word search" is an n x m rectangle of letters.  The goal is to find all
    of the possible words (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, etc.).  In Boggle, a similar game, any consecutive chain of letters (even repetitions)
    are allowed.  Explain (in very high-level psuedo-code) how you might solve this problem with a TrieSet or a TrieMap.  Make sure to detail
    how a similar solution that uses a HashSet/HashMap instead would be different and why using a Trie might make the solution better.<pre>

-   One of the classes in the main package is called Zip.  This class uses your PriorityQueue to do Huffman coding, your FIFOQueue as a buffer,
    your stack to calculate the keyset of a trie (using recursive backtracking), and your SuffixTrie to do LZ77Compression.  Find some text file
    (a free book from https://www.gutenberg.org/ or even the HTML of some website) and use Zip.java to zip it into a zip file.  Then, use a 
    standard zip utility on your machine (Finder on OS X, zip on Linux, WinZip or the like on Windows) to UNZIP your file.  Check that you got back
    the original.  Congratulations!  Your program correctly implements the same compression algorithm you have been using for years!  Discuss in a
    sentence or two how good the compression was and why you think it was good or bad.<pre>
